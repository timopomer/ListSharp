# ListSharp Programming Language

**Welcome to ListSharp!**

ListSharp is a programming language made in its entirety in c#, with an easy to understand, word-heavy english syntax made to suit the average person which is without previous and or limited knowledge in programming.

The Main Objective of ListSharp is to enable the manipulation of big lists and or blobs of text in an orderly fashion without learning a general use programming language, like for example learn Python and maybe get experienced with RegEx just to save a list of products on a webpage to a file.

ListSharp comes pre equipped with powerful algorithmic tools for information extraction and easy to understand concepts for web scraping and automation workloads.

* ListSharp is an expandable platform of useful functions for the manipulation of text. most manipulation algorithems are single liners without the need to study the code or understand how its done you can get everything up and running in minutes.
* ListSharp does not need editing programs to code in, while notpad will do there is an [official editor](https://github.com/timopomer/ListSharpIDE)
* ListSharp is extremely simplistic, writing ListSharp code is like explaining the computer what you want just like in your head.
* ListSharp functions are logically named, you will appreciate the the word rich syntax when you read it after some time.

* Locate transpiler executeable, default in /bin/Debug

#### On windows

* Win+R
* Type `cmd`, OK
* In the command line Type `<Path to ListSharp.exe> "<Path to .ls file>"`
* You can save this as a `.bat` file to quickly execute these commands

#### On mac

* [Install mono](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/mac/)
* Open terminal
* Type `mono <Path to ListSharp.exe> <Path to .ls file>`
* You can save this as a `.command` file (use `chmod u+x <Path .command file>`)

#### On both platforms
